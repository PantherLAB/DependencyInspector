This tool employs a private linker method to analyze the relationships between LabVIEW files. This method requires a LabVIEW file (VI, LVlib, LVclass, or CTL) as input and generates an array containing all the links associated with that file. A key advantage of this method is that it does not necessitate opening the LabVIEW file itself.

## Getting Started

Open LabVIEW and go to Tools-->PantherLAB-->Simple Dependency Inspector
