This tool employs a private linker method to analyze the relationships between LabVIEW files. This method requires a LabVIEW file (VI, LVlib, LVclass, or CTL) as input and generates an array containing all the links associated with that file. A key advantage of this method is that it does not necessitate opening the LabVIEW file itself.

## Getting Started

Open LabVIEW and go to Tools-->PantherLAB-->Simple Dependency Inspector

## Instructions

![Dependency Inspector Instructions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd7fd67a-af37-429e-8e33-1147a1bb71a4)

1. Choose the LabVIEW Code Folder Container.
2. Select the specific folders or files you want to analyze for dependencies.
3. If you selected a folder, you can specify which files within it to scan for dependencies.
4. Customize your graphical preferences for nodes and arrows. I recommend using random colors for the arrows, as this provides the most efficient way to analyze relationships.
5. Click the "Find Dependencies from Selection" button.
