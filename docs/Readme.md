This tool employs a private linker method to analyze the relationships between LabVIEW files. This method requires a LabVIEW file (VI, LVlib, LVclass, or CTL) as input and generates an array containing all the links associated with that file. A key advantage of this method is that it does not necessitate opening the LabVIEW file itself.

## Getting Started

Open LabVIEW and go to Tools-->PantherLAB-->Simple Dependency Inspector

## Instructions

![Instructions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfc28802-3ec5-479d-b72d-c6080fe0481f)

1. Choose the Folder containing your LabVIEW code
2. Select the specific files or folders you want to analyze for dependencies. Use Shift key to select multiple items.
3. If you selected folders, specify the LabVIEW file types to include in the analysis.
4. Select the file types you want to include in your plot.
5. Decife whether to include all LabVIEW dependencies in the plot. Be aware that this might result in a large a complex diagram that may be difficult to interpret.
6. Click the "Find Dependencies from Selection" button to begin the analysis.

## Symbols

Dependency Inspector creates 2d pictures with different symbols depending on the file type:

1. Library files (*.lvlib)
2. Virtual Instrument (*.vi)
3. Typedefs (*.ctl)
4. Class (*.lvclass)
